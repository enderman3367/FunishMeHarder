Toybox - Experimental Features and Debug Gameplay
=================================================

A special gameplay mode accessible from the main menu. This is where
experimental features and debug tools can be tested in a controlled
environment.

Features:
- Simple box characters (red and blue)
- Flat stage with a central platform and no fall-off hazards
- Standard game controls and physics
- Plays a special sound when opened
