State Manager - Game State Management System
=============================================

Manages different game states (Menu, Character Select, Gameplay, Pause, etc.)
Uses the State pattern to handle transitions and state-specific logic.

TODO:
- Implement state machine with proper transitions
- Handle state-specific input processing
- Manage state stack for pause/resume functionality
- Add smooth transitions between states
- Implement state persistence for save/load

Game States to implement:
- MainMenuState: Main menu with play, options, quit
- CharacterSelectState: Character selection for both players
- StageSelectState: Stage selection screen
- GameplayState: Main fighting gameplay
- PauseState: Pause overlay during gameplay
- ResultsState: Post-match results screen
- OptionsState: Settings and configuration
