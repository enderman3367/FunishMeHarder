Game Engine - Core game management system
==========================================

This module contains the main GameEngine class that coordinates all game systems.
The engine handles the main game loop, system updates, and overall game state.

TODO:
- Implement main game loop with fixed timestep for physics
- Coordinate between all game systems (physics, graphics, audio, input)
- Handle frame rate management (60 FPS target)
- Implement delta time calculations for smooth animations
- Add performance monitoring and FPS display
- Handle screen resolution changes and fullscreen toggle

Architecture Strategy:
- Use Entity-Component-System (ECS) pattern for flexible game objects
- Implement observer pattern for event handling
- Use state pattern for game state management
- Separate update and render phases for better performance
